# Project Objective

To demonstrate the effect of treatment effect exaggeration in underpowered experiments.

## Description

This project is inspired by a paper published by Ron Kohavi on common A/B testing mistakes that can lead to incorrect conclusions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oK2HpKKXeQLX6gQeQpfEaCGZtNr2kR76/view. 

One of these mistakes is running underpowered experiments, which can cause surprising statistically significant results even when no actual effect exists.

The calculations are performed for my personal understanding of this phenomenon.
