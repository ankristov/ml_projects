# Project Objective

This project is part of the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

The goal is to practice RNN implementation by addressing the task of recognizing emotions in tweets and matching them with corresponding emojis.

Several neural networks were built, and the results were logged using MLflow for comparison and preparation for production.
