# Project Objective

This project is part of the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

The goal is to practice RNN implementation by tackling the task of recognizing human-written date formats and transforming them into a unified machine-readable format.

Several neural networks of different sizes were built. The results were logged using MLflow for comparison and to identify the best-performing model.
